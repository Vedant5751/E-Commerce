echo === Jenkins CI/CD Pipeline Demo ===
echo.

echo 1. Jenkins Pipeline Features:
echo - Multi-stage pipeline with parallel execution
echo - Automated testing and code quality checks
echo - Security scanning with Trivy
echo - Docker image building and scanning
echo - Container registry push to AWS ECR
echo - Kubernetes deployment automation
echo - Health checks and rollback capabilities
echo - Slack notifications for build status
echo.

echo 2. Pipeline Stages:
echo   ✓ Checkout - Git repository checkout
echo   ✓ Build Frontend - npm install and build
echo   ✓ Build Backend - npm install and build
echo   ✓ Test - Parallel frontend and backend testing
echo   ✓ Security Scan - Trivy vulnerability scanning
echo   ✓ Docker Build - Multi-stage Docker builds
echo   ✓ Docker Scan - Container image security scanning
echo   ✓ Docker Push - Push to AWS ECR registry
echo   ✓ Deploy to Staging - Automated staging deployment
echo   ✓ Deploy to Production - Automated production deployment
echo   ✓ Health Check - Post-deployment verification
echo.

echo 3. Key Jenkins Benefits:
echo - Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment
echo - Automated testing and quality assurance
echo - Security scanning and vulnerability detection
echo - Container orchestration and deployment
echo - Multi-environment deployment strategies
echo - Build artifact management
echo - Team collaboration and notifications
echo.

echo 4. Jenkins Configuration:
echo - Pipeline as Code with Jenkinsfile
echo - Docker integration for containerized builds
echo - Kubernetes integration for deployment
echo - AWS ECR integration for container registry
echo - Slack integration for notifications
echo - Parallel execution for faster builds
echo - Conditional deployment based on branches
echo.

echo 5. Demo Commands:
echo To start Jenkins:
echo   docker-compose -f jenkins/docker-compose.yml up -d
echo.
echo To access Jenkins:
echo   http://localhost:8080
echo   Username: admin
echo   Password: [from initial setup]
echo.
echo To create pipeline:
echo   1. New Item ^> Pipeline
echo   2. Configure pipeline from SCM
echo   3. Point to your Git repository
echo   4. Use Jenkinsfile from root directory
echo.
